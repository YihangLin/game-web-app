# Project Online Game Store
A E-Commerce website using React, Express and PostgreSQL. [View Site!](https://game-ecommerce-a5e9b.web.app/)

## Overview
It is a website for shopping games online. I built this project to exercise my previously gained React skills and manipulating data with apis in the front-end. I used Express as back-end and PostgreSQL as database. JWT is used for authentication and bcrypt is used for hashing users passwords. I enjoyed a lot building those apis and fetching data from them in React. I also used Redux to manage user states and cart actions. Stripe is used to process payments.
